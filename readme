The goal of this rc-car project is to control an rc-car over ethernet by a pc/smartphone. 

./car   this folder contains the code for the stm32 microcontroller of the car. It is written C with a little bit of assembler 
./docs  this folder contains documentation
./remote_control this folder contains the remote controlling apps. the Main app for linux is written in Python using PyGtk for the gui 


for compiling the stm32 arm code I used the sat[1] toolchain on a fedora machine.

Remote Cotrolling protocol:
A package consists of:

for the standart UPDATE_MODE package, the message text consinst of:
[index_for_var_a][a_space][value_for_var_a][a_space].....up to a length of 255bytes!
