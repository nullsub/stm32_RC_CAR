I want to control a RC-CAR with the stm32-discovery Board. 
FreeRTOS is used as Real time OS. Following tasks are implemented:
	Servo Task:
		Does all the Servo timing.
	Term Task:
	  	This task provides a Terminal like interface over USART which lets you
		 control/test and debug the servos and various sensors with the PC
	Sensor Task/API:
		Is responsible for logging of the sensors and provides a standart interface 
		for all sensors.

TODO/currnent state:
	-Servos are working. but STRANGE BUG.. TODO!!!!!
	-Term task is written but not tested
	-no sensors have been added yet
	-motor controlling has not been tested
	-radio transmission still needs some thoughts.... I think the the RFXX chips 
	 	are quite nice...
